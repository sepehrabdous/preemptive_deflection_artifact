# Practical Packet Deflection in Datacenters - paper artifacts

This contains the artifacts for network simulations and switch implementations of Simple Deflection, Quantile-based Preemptive Deflection, and Distribution-based Preemptive Deflection. Please refer to the README file in the ``Omnet_Sims`` directory for instructions on how to run the simulations and reproduce results. The README file in the ``Switch_Implementations`` directory will guide you to the control plane and data plane code of each module.

Please refer to our CoNEXT '23 paper for more information about Simple and Preemptive Deflection.
