	Added a new generic and efficient multidimensional mathematical function API.
	This API is mostly useful for the physical layer signal processing.

	Added core classes are Point, Interval, and Domain.
	Added core interfaces are IInterpolator and IFunction.

	Added interpolators are EitherInterpolator, LeftInterpolator, RightInterpolator,
	MinimumInterpolator, MaximumInterpolator, AverageInterpolator, CloserInterpolator,
	and LinearInterpolator.

	Added primitive functions are ConstantFunction, LinearFunction, BilinearFunction,
	ReciprocalFunction, OneDimensionalBoxcarFunction, OneDimensionalInterpolatedFunction,
	TwoDimensionalBoxcarFunction, and GaussFunction.

	Added function operators are AdditionFunction, SubtractionFunction, MultiplicationFunction,
	DivisionFunction, and SumFunction.

	Added function compositors are DomainLimitedFunction, ShiftFunction, OrthogonalCombinatorFunction
	ApproximatedFunction, ExtrudedFunction, IntegratedFunction, and MemoizedFunction.
